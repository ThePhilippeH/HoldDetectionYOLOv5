Welcome to the HoldDetectionYOLOv5 project!

## Description
HoldDetectionYOLOv5 is a computer vision project that aims to detect and classify climbing holds in bouldering images using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm.

<!-- ## Features
- Object detection: The project utilizes the YOLOv5 algorithm to detect climbing holds in bouldering images.
- Classification: The detected holds are classified into different types such as crimps, jugs, slopers, and pockets.
- Training: The project provides scripts and instructions for training the YOLOv5 model on custom datasets.
- Evaluation: The performance of the trained model can be evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).
- Inference: Once the model is trained, it can be used for inference on new bouldering images to detect and classify holds.

    <!-- ## Installation -->
    1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/HoldDetectionYOLOv5.git`
    2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` -->

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset: Organize your bouldering images and annotation files in the required format.
2. Train the model: Run the training script and specify the paths to your dataset.
3. Evaluate the model: Use the evaluation script to assess the performance of the trained model.
4. Perform inference: Apply the trained model on new bouldering images to detect and classify holds.
